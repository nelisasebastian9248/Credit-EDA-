Credit Risk Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📌 Overview
This project conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on credit risk assessment, examining various factors that contribute to loan defaults and making data-driven recommendations. The analysis explores applicant demographics, credit scores, previous loan history, and key determinants influencing default risks.

📂 Contents
**Insights from Current Applications**
Analysis of income groups, credit limits, and age groups in relation to default rates.
Correlation between external credit scores and default likelihood.

**Merged Data Analysis (Current & Previous Applications)**
Impact of approved vs. refused loans on default probabilities.
Credit amount distribution across different loan types.

**Key Findings on Loan Applications**
Higher default rates observed in applicants whose previous loans were refused or canceled.
Relationship between income range and credit limits on repayment behavior.
Loan approval trends based on age groups, employment history, and contract types.

**Key Risk Indicators**
Influence of education, employment status, income type, and age on default risks.
Gender-based credit risk analysis.
Occupational categories with high default rates.

**Predictors of Loan Defaults**
Statistical correlation between demographics, employment, and financial history with loan repayment behavior.
Risk segmentation based on income levels, loan amount, and family status.

**Recommendations**
Identifying safe applicant categories for lending.
Suggesting higher interest rates for high-risk applicants to offset potential losses.
Adjusting lending strategies based on past loan approvals and defaults.

**Conclusion**
Low-risk groups (e.g., educated, older applicants with stable income).
High-risk groups (e.g., unemployed, young applicants, and those with previous refusals).

📈 Key Takeaways
✔️ Clients with strong credit history and higher education levels are less likely to default.
✔️ Young applicants and low-income earners show higher risks.
✔️ Loan refusals in previous applications correlate with higher default rates in current applications.
✔️ Introducing higher interest rates for high-risk applicants can mitigate potential losses.

💡 Future Work
Enhancing credit risk prediction using machine learning models.
Incorporating real-time credit scoring with external datasets.
Developing automated risk assessment dashboards.
